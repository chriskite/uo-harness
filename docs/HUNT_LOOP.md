# Hunt loop (`harness/loop_hunt.py`)

A programmatic task like the lumber loop: fight monsters at one spot, heal, loot, leave when
hurt. Built for New Player Dungeon mongbats (user decision 2026-10-01: the thresholds are task
arguments). Start it with `ctl run hunt [args…]` (docs/OVERSEER.md) or directly:

```
python harness/loop_hunt.py --kills 5                 # standing in the NPD
python harness/loop_hunt.py --enter --kills 5         # from outside the entrance
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--spot X Y` | `5535 529` | The tile to fight on (the NPD exit tile). Leaving starts here. |
| `--exit-dir D` | `4` (south) | The step from the spot onto the exit teleporter. |
| `--enter` | off | Start outside: walk to `--entry`, step `--entry-dir` to teleport in. |
| `--entry X Y Z` / `--entry-dir D` | `1912 2557 -20` / `0` | The tile before the NPD entrance teleporter and the step that triggers it. |
| `--heal-at` | `0.75` | Heal below this share of max hits (healing.py: a heal potion if one can be drunk, else a spell). |
| `--gheal-min-missing` | the mana break-even for your Magery (19 at 60) | Missing hits from which the heal spell is Greater Heal; below it, Heal. |
| `--leave-at` | `0.60` | Leave below this share of max hits. |
| `--leave-multi-at` | `0.80` | Leave below this share when two or more mobs are attacking. |
| `--mana-reserve` | `22` | Mana kept for heals (two Greater Heals): the attack spell only while mana ≥ reserve + its cost. |
| `--spell` | `lightning` | Attack spell (Magery name or 1-64). |
| `--target-name` | `mongbat` | Words the monster's name (or click label) must contain. |
| `--pull-range` | `3` | Engage mobs within this many tiles of the spot. |
| `--kills N` | `0` | Stop after N kills (0: until `--timeout`). |
| `--timeout S` | `3600` | Then finish the fights on us, loot, and leave. 180 s past it the runner aborts wherever it is. |
| `--rest-to` | `0.95` | After leaving: Heal / Greater Heal (no potions) and regenerate outside to this share of hits (and `--mana-reserve` mana), then go back in. `0`: stop after leaving. `--rest-timeout` (900 s) bounds the rest. |
| `--loot` / `--no-loot`, `--loot-max` | on, 25 | Loot our kills' corpses (items per corpse). |
| `--human`, `--seed`, `--human-fast`, `--no-map`, `--quiet`, `--triage-url`, ports, `--memory` | | As in the lumber runner. |

## What it does

Each tick re-reads the proxy state and decides, in this order:

1. **Leave** when a rule fires (`threat` juncture, job event `leave`):
   - a hostile player (threats.py: red/grey/orange) within 12 tiles: urgent; the run stops outside;
   - two or more attackers and hits below `--leave-multi-at`;
   - hits below `--leave-at`.
   Leaving is war mode off (if on), back to the spot, then the step in `--exit-dir`. The runner
   expects a teleport: a deny followed by the move (the NPD exit, live), or a confirmed step and the
   move right after. Outside it rests and goes back in (except after a hostile player).
2. **Speech hold** (speech_guard.py, as in the lumber runner) once no fight is on: nothing is sent
   until the overseer acks `speech_nearby`. Leaving to survive overrides the hold.
3. **Heal** below `--heal-at`, one heal per tick (`harness/healing.py`, shared with `ctl act heal`;
   user decision 2026-10-02):
   - **A heal potion whenever one can be drunk**: any heal potion (graphic `0x0F0C`) in the
     backpack at any bag depth, smallest stack first, its bags opened first, the stock
     double-click. "Can be drunk" means not at full health and 10 s since the last drink (the
     runner's own clock). If the server still refuses (cliloc 500235, e.g. after a drink in the
     client), the clock restarts and a spell goes out in the same tick.
   - **Otherwise a spell by the missing hits**: Greater Heal ((40–50) × Magery/100 for 11 mana)
     once the missing hits reach `--gheal-min-missing`, else Heal ((10–12) × Magery/100 for 4
     mana; wiki Magery). The default threshold is the mana break-even, where Greater Heal
     restores more hits per mana than Heal: Heal's average × 11 / 4 (19 at Magery 60). If the
     chosen spell can't be paid for, the other one is cast.
   - **No potion and no mana for Heal:** one `low_supplies` juncture per visit.
   - **Resting outside:** spells only. Mana regenerates for free there, while potions cost gold.
4. **Loot** our kills' corpses when nothing is attacking us, like `ctl act loot`: human corpses
   refused, walk within 2 tiles, open the backpack (stock dclick) and the corpse, then lift + drop
   each item into the backpack, gold first, up to the weight limit.
5. **Fight** the target:
   - Targets come only from the live world model (`world.mobiles` holds what the stock client still
     has; docs/WORLDMODEL.md) and pass the `ctl act attack` guard (`combat.attackable`: threats.py
     monster, notoriety 3-6, on screen). Serials the server reported dead (`mobile_death`) are never
     targeted.
   - A mob swinging at us (`world.swings`, within 10 s) comes first: the current one, else the one
     with the lowest hits. Otherwise the nearest within `--pull-range` of the spot.
   - Attack once (war mode on, `0x34` unless the client has a status request outstanding, `0x05`),
     and once more when the mob first comes adjacent (the overseer's NPD procedure).
   - The attack spell while the mana allows and the mob is within 10 tiles: cast, wait for the
     cursor, a human aim pause, **re-read the state**, then `0x6C` on the mob's current tile. If the
     mob is gone meanwhile, or a leave rule fired while aiming, the cursor gets the stock Esc
     `0x6C` instead (ANTICHEAT.md §10 A12). "That is too far away" / "cannot be seen" means melee
     only at that mob for 10 s.
6. **Idle**: war mode off when nothing is near, back to the spot, wait.

A kill is our target's `prune` (why dead) or `0x1D`, or its `mobile_death` (S2C `0xFF` sub `0xDEAD`,
which also names the corpse). Live, an in-view kill is `0xAF` + `0x1D` + `0xDEAD` at once
(capture 20261001_214649).

Packets come from `harness/combat.py`, shared with `ctl act attack/target/loot/cast` so the two can't
drift: `attack_packets`, `target_mobile`, `target_self`, `grab_packets`, `loot_order`,
`human_corpse`, `attackable`, `spell_id`.

## Guards

Overall timeout, movement stall, the agent gate (actions wait out a pause or break), server
restriction text (`server_restriction` juncture, stop), death (`death` juncture with the attackers
and threats, stop: no corpse runs), the speech hold above.

## Memory

One episode per visit (loop `hunt`): `visit`, `t_start`/`t_end`, `spot`, `spell`, `hits_start`,
`kills`, `gold`, `xp`, `hits_lost`, `casts`, `heals`, `leaves`, `ended` (the leave reason, `done`, `time
is up` or `stopped`). Job events `kill`, `loot` (`mob`, `name`, `gold`, `xp`, items), `leave`, `death`,
`speech_hold`, `speech_clear`. Gold looted is the backpack gold delta (or the status gold delta,
whichever is larger; the loot act's own reply was unreliable live).

**XP** is Outlands mastery-chain experience: a kill gives the creature's gold value × our damage
share ([wiki Experience_Gain](https://wiki.uooutlands.com/Experience_Gain); no mastery chain needed
to accumulate it). No capture shows a per-kill XP message (docs/NOTES.md "Experience"), so `xp` is the gold the corpse held when
opened, before looting [INFERENCE: equal to the creature's value for a solo kill; the weekly bonus
and Fortune scale gold and XP alike per the wiki]. Unlooted kills have no `xp`. The Jobs page's
Hunting dashboard shows kills, gold and XP (docs/VISUALIZER.md §2.4).

## Test

`python test_loop_hunt.py` (~20 s, private ports): a simulated NPD behind the real proxy. A mongbat
that died to someone else (`0xDEAD` only) must never be touched; the first mongbat flies in and hits
hard (heal path), dies to Lightning, its gold is looted; two more come in swinging and trigger the
two-attacker rule; the runner rests outside with a Greater Heal and goes back in; the one the server
doesn't re-send (pruned, out of range) must never be targeted; the second kill ends the run outside.
Attack, cast, target, cancel and loot packets are compared byte-wise with the builders.

## Live (2026-10-02, Hackworth, NPD, runs 1–11 under the overseer)

72 counted kills and ~980 gold in ~3 h 15 min. Leaving below `--leave-at`, the exit teleport, resting
outside and re-entering all worked; no deaths. Heal potions were drunk live (healing.py). Logs:
`logs/tasks/hunt-20261002-*.log` (local).

- **`--pull-range 3` idles** while bats sit 5–6 tiles from the exit tile; 8 engaged the room.
- **Non-target attackers are never fought.** `pick_target` filters every candidate, attackers
  included, by `--target-name` (`wanted()`); a wounded harpy and giant rats on the exit tile took
  ~45 hits in 10–15 s per visit while the runner waited for a mongbat. `status.attackers` stayed
  empty for them too. Workaround: `--target-name ''` (any monster the attack guard allows).
  Fix needed: attackers should bypass the name filter.
- **Heal isn't always in the spellbook.** healing.py picks Heal for small losses; Hackworth's book
  lacks it ("You do not have that spell!"). Workaround `--gheal-min-missing 1`. Fix needed: choose
  only spells the book holds.
- **A speech hold sends nothing, even mid-fight**: no heals and no swings. Hits fell 99 → 48 until
  the survival leave overrode the hold. Combat and heals should continue during a hold.
- **The rest ends at the mana reserve.** With the default 22 it re-entered with ~24 mana, cast it
  away and bounced out in 25 s. `--mana-reserve 70` made visits last.
- **The arrival tile (5536,530) is also an exit teleporter.** Walking back from a corpse over it
  put the runner outside, and it aborted "back to the spot: no route" (it plans inside only).
- **Counted kills overstate income in a crowded room.** Tamers' pets take killing blows (loot is
  theirs), so 30–100 % of a run's kills were empty or had no corpse.
- Logged heal deltas often read +1 ("greater heal: 46 -> 47"): the hits are read before the heal
  lands.
- Many casts are ruined by hits (cliloc 500641) or spell recovery (502644). Mongbats inflict
  "Diseased" (damage every 5 s).

## Not yet

- The spell range (10) and the corpse wait (4 s) are [INFERENCE].
